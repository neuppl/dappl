dappl is a tiny language to reason about bayesian maximum expected utility.

make sure your opam environment is set to 4.14.1 before doing anything too crazy, like building.

To build, clone `rsdd-dappl` and `rsdd-ocaml-dappl` from Minsung's github and use those instead of the usual `rsdd` and `rsdd-ocaml`.
