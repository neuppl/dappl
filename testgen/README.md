This folder has utilities for the automatic generation of `dappl` (and to a lesser extent, `problog`) programs.

Open each file to see their functionalities.

* `mk_expr.ml` is a library for printing `dappl` strings.
* `mk_expr_dt.ml` is a library for printing a fragment of `problog`. 
* `dappl_benchmarks.ml` generates the HMM and network examples.
* `gen.ml` generates Bayesian network benchmarks.
* `method.ml` replicates the methodology used in Derkinderen et al., 2020.
* The folders contain `dappl` (and `problog`) files for the respective benchmarks.
